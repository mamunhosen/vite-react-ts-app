# Rapid App Starter With Vite 

This is a template project to help you get started with Vite, Typescript, Eslint, Prettier, Vitest, and Jest-DOM. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mamunhosen/vite-react-ts-app.git
cd vite-react-ts-app
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project. 

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```


This will start the Vite development server and a development URL will be provided in the terminal, which can be accessed by clicking on it using the `cmd + click` command. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically updated in the browser.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the project, run the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```

This will run the Vitest and Jest-DOM tests for your project.

## Code Quality

This project uses Eslint to enforce code quality standards. We have included a configuration file in the `src` directory, which specifies the rules that we use.

When you save a file in this project, the linter will automatically check your code for errors and warnings. This can help you catch problems before they become serious issues.

If you're contributing to this project, please be sure to run your code through the linter to ensure that it meets our standards. You can also configure your text editor or IDE to show linting errors on the fly, so that you can quickly identify and fix any issues as you work.

If you encounter any issues with the linting configuration or have suggestions for improving it, please let us know by creating an issue on the project's GitHub page.

## Formatting

This project uses Prettier for code formatting. A Prettier configuration file is included in the `src` directory. We recommend setting up your editor to use this configuration file to ensure consistent code formatting. 

You can find instructions on how to configure your editor to use Prettier here: https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html
